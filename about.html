            <h4>Noy Chatoyan</h4>   
            <p>Skills and Specialties: My background is in business, graphic and product design. I have spent a lot of time creating with the thought of how specific consumers will interact with product ideas, logos, etc. I can apply this practice to this project. All my knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery have all come from Dev 1. Though, I am much stronger in HTML and CSS. I have created websites for various businesses I have started (without code --> Shopify, Wix, etc) so I have an understanding of how websites should flow and be interacted with.</p>

            <p>Skills and Specialties: I would say that filmmaking, storytelling, rendering and graphic design are my strong suits. I’ve had experience creating logos, style guides and short commercial videos for different clients so I believe I can also bring my negotiation skills for this project. Additionally, prior to this class, I’ve had some experience with programming so I should have a good foundation to bring our client’s vision to life through a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery. Although, if we ever face any obstacles during this process, I know my team and I will have the tenacity to problem solve together.</p>

        <h4>Alexis Kim</h4>   
        <p>Although I haven't had prior experience in design or coding, I believe I've built a good foundation throughout this year. I've especially been focusing on certain aspects such as logo design or prototypes. My strengths are creativity for ideation and visualization in the 3d space as a hands-on crafter and modeler.
